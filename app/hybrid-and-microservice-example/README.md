## Sample Nestjs hybrid app.

A very simple example of a Nestjs hybrid app. Hybrid apps have embedded microservices. 

Note that in general, this is regarded as an anti-pattern but it can keep things simplle for smaller apps
and at the same time the micro-services can easily be unbundled if necessary.
